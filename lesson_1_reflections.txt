How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
FC shows the lines of the file that have changed or been added in the new file. 
This lets us look at specifically those lines in the new version that weren't in the old one.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Helps us keep track of the old versions so that they can be reused if the new version is buggy.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros-Manual commits have a logical purpose
Cons-Forgetting to commit often

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is code oriented.Since programs are usually seperated into multiple files git allows multiple files in one commit.
A document on google docs may be independent of any other document,so Google Docs treats each file seperately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log-history of all commits with a short descrition associated with each commit
git diff-difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always checkout a previous version which had no bugs.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For version control obviously!
